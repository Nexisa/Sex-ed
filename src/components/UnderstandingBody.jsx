                What is Puberty?
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>Puberty is the time when your body begins to develop and change as you grow into an adult. It’s driven by hormonal changes that signal your body to start maturing. During puberty, your body becomes capable of reproduction, which means for girls, you may begin menstruating, and for boys, sperm production begins.</p>
                <p>The onset of puberty is different for everyone. For most girls, puberty starts between the ages of 8 and 13, while boys tend to start a bit later, between ages 9 and 14. These ages are just averages, though—some people may start earlier or later, and that’s completely normal.</p>

                Physical Changes During Puberty
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>Puberty is known for the many physical changes that occur. Let’s break down some of the key changes you might notice during this time:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto">
                    <li>Growth Spurt: One of the first signs of puberty is a noticeable increase in height. You may suddenly grow taller in a short amount of time, and you might feel clumsy as your body adjusts to its new size.</li>
                    <li>Body Hair: Hair starts to grow in new places, such as under your arms, on your legs, and in the pubic area. For boys, facial hair and chest hair may also start to appear.</li>
                    <li>Acne and Oily Skin: Due to increased activity in your oil glands, you might develop pimples or acne. This is a common and normal part of puberty, and there are ways to manage it by keeping your skin clean and using appropriate skincare products.</li>
                    <li>Sweating and Body Odour: As your sweat glands become more active, you may notice a stronger body odor, especially in the underarm area. Personal hygiene, such as regular showers and using deodorant, can help you feel fresh and confident.</li>
                    <li>Breast Development (in girls): Girls will notice their breasts beginning to grow, which is one of the earliest signs of puberty. This process can take several years to complete, and it’s perfectly normal for breast sizes to vary between individuals.</li>
                    <li>Voice Changes (in boys): Boys will notice their voices getting deeper, often referred to as the "voice cracking" phase. This happens as the voice box (larynx) grows, making the voice sound lower.</li>
                    <li>Menstruation (in girls): For girls, menstruation (or having your period) is a major milestone of puberty. It’s the body’s way of preparing for the possibility of pregnancy. Your period is part of the menstrual cycle, which usually lasts about 28 days. Don’t worry if your periods are irregular at first—this is common as your body adjusts.</li>
                    <li>Genital Changes (in boys): Boys will notice their testicles and penis getting larger. This is a sign that the body is starting to produce sperm, which is needed for reproduction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These changes are all part of your body maturing, and while they might feel strange at first, they are natural and expected.</p>

                Emotional and Mental Changes During Puberty
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">

                </div>
                <p>Puberty isn’t just about physical changes—it’s also a time when you’ll experience new and sometimes intense emotions. This is due in part to the increase in hormones, which can affect your mood and how you feel about yourself and others.</p>
                <p>Here are some common emotional changes you might experience:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto">
                    <li>Mood Swings: It’s normal to feel happy one moment and upset the next. These emotional shifts are common and are often related to hormonal changes in your body. It’s important to talk to someone if you feel overwhelmed by these emotions.</li>
                    <li>Self-Consciousness: As your body changes, you may become more aware of how you look and feel self-conscious about your appearance. Remember that everyone goes through these changes at different times, and there’s no right or wrong way to experience puberty.</li>
                    <li>Attraction to Others: During puberty, it’s normal to start developing romantic or sexual feelings for others. These feelings might be confusing at first, but it’s all part of growing up. It’s important to take your time and respect your own and others' boundaries as you figure out what feels right for you.</li>
                    <li>Desire for Independence: You may start to feel like you want more independence from your parents or guardians. This is a natural part of growing up, but it’s still important to communicate openly with the people around you as you navigate this newfound sense of freedom.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It’s okay to feel unsure about these changes. Talking to someone you trust—like a parent, guardian, or counsellor—can help you process these emotions.</p>

                Hormones: The Driving Force Behind Puberty
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>Hormones are the body’s chemical messengers, and they play a big role in puberty. The main hormones involved are:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto">
                    <li>Testosterone (in boys): This hormone is responsible for many of the changes boys experience during puberty, such as muscle growth, the deepening of the voice, and the growth of facial hair.</li>
                    <li>Estrogen and Progesterone (in girls): These hormones are responsible for breast development, the start of menstruation, and the growth of the uterus. They also regulate the menstrual cycle.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hormones are what trigger the start of puberty, and they continue to play a role in your physical and emotional development throughout this time.</p>

                When Does Puberty End?
            </h1>
            <p>Puberty doesn’t have a set endpoint, but most of the major physical changes are complete by the time you’re in your late teens. For girls, puberty usually finishes by around age 16 to 17, and for boys, it can continue until around age 18 to 20. Even after these changes, your body will continue to develop in small ways as you move into adulthood.</p>

                How to Cope with Puberty
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>Puberty can feel overwhelming, but there are ways to manage these changes and feel more in control:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto">
                    <li>Talk to Someone: Whether it’s a parent, a trusted adult, or a healthcare professional, talking about your concerns can help you better understand what’s happening and provide reassurance that your experiences are normal.</li>
                    <li>Practice Self-Care: Taking care of your body is important during puberty. Eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and get plenty of sleep to help your body adjust to the changes it’s going through.</li>
                    <li>Maintain Good Hygiene: Shower regularly, especially after physical activities, to keep your skin clean and manage body odour. Don’t forget to wash your face to reduce the likelihood of acne.</li>
                    <li>Be Patient with Yourself: Everyone experiences puberty differently, and it’s important not to compare yourself to others. Embrace the changes at your own pace, and remember that it’s okay to feel confused or even frustrated at times.</li>
                </ul>
