                Changes in the Male Body During Puberty
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>During puberty, the male body undergoes a variety of changes due to the increased production of testosterone:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto">
                    <li>Growth of Body Hair: Boys will notice hair growth in the pubic area, underarms, legs, and sometimes on the chest and face.</li>
                    <li>Voice Deepening: The voice box, or larynx, grows larger, which causes the voice to deepen. This often happens gradually and is accompanied by a period where the voice may "crack" or change pitch unpredictably.</li>
                    <li>Increased Muscle Mass: Testosterone helps increase muscle development, and many boys will notice a more defined physique as they grow.</li>
                    <li>Growth of Genitalia: The penis and testicles will grow larger during puberty as the body becomes capable of reproduction.</li>
                    <li>Erections and Ejaculation: Boys will begin to experience erections and ejaculations. Erections can happen for no reason at all and are completely normal. Ejaculation is the release of semen, which contains sperm, and can happen during sexual arousal or even in sleep (nocturnal emissions, or "wet dreams").</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These changes may happen at different times for different boys, and there is no set timeline for when everything will occur.</p>

                Changes in the Female Body During Puberty
            </h1>
            <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>For girls, puberty is driven by the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which cause several key changes in the body:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc w-11/12 mx-auto">
                    <li>Breast Development: One of the earliest signs of puberty in girls is the growth of breasts. This process happens gradually over several years and varies widely from person to person.</li>
                    <li>Start of Menstruation: Girls will begin to menstruate (have periods) during puberty, which signals that their bodies are capable of reproduction. The menstrual cycle typically lasts about 28 days, although it can be shorter or longer, especially in the first few years.</li>
                    <li>Growth of Body Hair: Like boys, girls will also notice the growth of hair in the pubic area, underarms, and on the legs.</li>
                    <li>Widening of Hips: As the body prepares for the potential of pregnancy, girls' hips may widen, giving the body a more defined, curvier shape.</li>
                    <li>Increased Body Fat: Girls may notice an increase in body fat, particularly around the hips and thighs, which is a normal part of development.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Puberty is different for every girl. Some girls may start menstruating earlier or later than others, and that is completely normal.</p>

                How the Male and Female Reproductive Systems Work Together
            </h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The male and female reproductive systems are designed to work together to allow for reproduction. During sexual intercourse, sperm from the male is deposited into the female’s reproductive system. If a sperm cell successfully fertilizes an egg released by the female’s ovaries, the fertilized egg will implant in the uterus, where it can develop into a baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If fertilization doesn’t occur, the egg will break down, and the lining of the uterus will be shed during menstruation. This cycle repeats itself roughly once a month.
